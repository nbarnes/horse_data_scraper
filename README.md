This website scraping tool is built to pull information about Trakehner horses
out of websites and build it into a form we can consume to populate our own
Trakehner data radiator site.

======================================
The data pulled by this tool is intended for use at our website, the
Unofficial Trakehner Database (www.theunofficialtrakehnerdatabase.com).  The
UTDB is a free service helping people search through the pedigrees and
information of horses of the Trakehner breed.  More information about the
Trakehner breed of horses can be found at
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trakehner and the American Trakehner Association
site at http://americantrakehner.com/
